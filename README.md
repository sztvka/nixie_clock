# Nixie Clock
![photo1](img/img2.jpg?raw=true "Photo")

My attempt at reusing scrapped nixie tubes with their good old driver ICs. 

## Hardware
 - Z5730M Nixie Tubes
 - 74141 IC drivers 
 - 12-180V boost converter designed by [Nick de Smith](https://desmith.net/NMdS/Electronics/NixiePSU.html), modified to suit the design
 - STM32F411 MCU for control

 This design uses voltage-level shifters to properly drive Nixie Tube ICs. Altium Designer files, software and 3d models are available in their respective directories.
